# 📱 PhoneLess — A Social Approach to Digital Wellbeing

**PhoneLess** is a project born from a simple question:  
> _What if we could reduce our screen time not by restriction, but through shared awareness and social accountability?_

Our mission is to help people **regain control of their attention** and build a healthier relationship with technology — together.

---

## 🌍 The Problem

In an age of constant notifications, infinite scrolling, and algorithmic design for addiction, people feel increasingly distracted, anxious, and disconnected.  
Most “screen time” apps focus on **self-control and limits**, but few address the **social and emotional side** of our phone habits.

We don’t need more discipline — we need **shared awareness**.

---

## 💡 The Idea

PhoneLess turns screen time reduction into a **social, collective challenge**.

Instead of tracking alone, users share their **daily or weekly screen time summaries** with a small group of friends or family.  
This visibility creates gentle accountability, positive pressure, and a sense of community — the same way **Strava motivates runners**, but for mindful phone use.

---

## 🧠 Why It Works

- **Social accountability:** sharing with others makes behavior change stick.  
- **Awareness > guilt:** transparency builds mindfulness, not shame.  
- **Micro-habit:** one small daily action — just share your screen time.  
- **Positive loops:** cheering each other creates motivation and belonging.  

Scientific studies in behavioral psychology and habit design support these mechanisms: feedback, social proof, and visibility improve consistency dramatically.

---

## 🔧 How It Works (Concept)

1. Connect your phone’s **screen time data** (via iOS Screen Time or Android Digital Wellbeing).  
2. Create or join a small **private group** (1–5 friends).  
3. Each day, your total screen time is automatically shared.  
4. See a **group leaderboard**, progress trends, and reduction percentages.  
5. Participate in weekly challenges or group milestones (optional).  
6. Celebrate progress together — not perfection.

---

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **Privacy-first:** you decide what to share — only totals, not app-level details.  
- **Supportive, not punitive:** focus on awareness and progress, never guilt.  
- **Minimal friction:** no endless settings or pop-ups — one daily number is enough.  
- **Data transparency:** open-source philosophy for data handling and impact.  
- **Social by design:** community drives change better than discipline alone.

## 💌 Team & Collaboration

This project started as a solo prototype but is evolving into a collective effort.

---

## 🧭 Philosophy

We’re not against technology — we’re against losing ourselves in it.  
The goal is not to “quit phones” but to **use them consciously**, with intention and presence.  
Technology should empower, not consume.
